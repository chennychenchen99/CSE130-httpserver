# httpserver
Simulates an HTTP server with implementation of PUT/GET requests, backup, recovery, and list.

## Usage

Type "make" into terminal to compile and link httpserver.cpp.

Run the executable with "./httpserver <hostname/ip address> [port]"

We based our code mainly off asgn1, so the HTTP server is not multi-threaded and there is no redundancy.
